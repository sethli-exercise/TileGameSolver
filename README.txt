In this game there is a 2-dimensional board comprised of tiles.
Each tile can be black or white, and every tile starts as a black tile.
When a player enters a new tile, the tile the player is on and all orthogonally adjacent tiles are flipped to the opposite color.

The player's goal is to make the every tile on the board white.
The player can only move 1 space in any orthogonal direction.
